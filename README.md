Hi, I'm @BassSkydiver.
Right now I'm training to code for my local robotics team, but I have some ideas for home projects/experiments.
I'm activly learning these programming languages:
  - Kotlin

I'm looking into:
  - C# (for game development)
  - Python (General-Purpose use)

My Tetris highscore is 25,498
